Notes
Company Acquisition and Growth Strategy
The team has secured controlling interest in Levesque, a well-equipped California beverage bottling company, with plans to expand through further acquisitions and operational improvements (02:38).

Gabriel Borden highlighted the strategy to first optimize Levesque’s existing operations and then raise funds to acquire additional beverage companies, aiming to build a vertically integrated portfolio.
The facility currently operates at about 15-20% utilization after a recent $35 million capacity expansion from 10 million to 35 million cases annually, presenting significant growth potential (19:38).
Chris Clifford emphasized the company’s current revenue of approximately $220 million with a goal to reach $300 million by year-end, and a pipeline capable of pushing revenue to between $400 and $500 million in the next few years (21:15).
The acquisition was a formal restructuring of a bankrupt entity, with the original owners retaining a 49% stake to maintain key customer relationships, while the new owners hold 51% control (18:44).
Manufacturing Capacity and Product Lines
Levesque operates multiple manufacturing lines with a strong focus on private label and co-packing, especially for large clients like Costco and Trader Joe’s, with expertise in challenging products such as eggnog (13:48).

The facility includes six bottling lines and two high-speed canning lines, including a $10-15 million Lionel canning line, described as top-tier equipment supporting a wide range of beverages, including cocktails and ready-to-drink (RTD) products (19:38).
They maintain an in-house formulation lab allowing custom product development and control over supply chains, supporting both private label with ready recipes and bespoke formulations (15:03).
The team is actively expanding into non-alcoholic beverages and has promising collaborations lined up with Pepsi and other suppliers to maximize canning line throughput (17:17).
Food safety and quality are prioritized, with strict CCP points in place, particularly for sensitive products like eggnog, reflecting the facility’s high standards (14:16).
Market Positioning and Industry Insights
The company’s strong foothold in private label for major brands like Kirkland vodka and hotel chains such as Marriott and Hilton positions it well within growing segments of the beverage market (13:48, 16:00).

Ricardo Cordero pointed out the explosive growth in canned cocktails and private label alcohol, noting the cruise ship market as a significant channel, reinforcing the strategic value of their product lines (16:08).
The team sees substantial opportunity in flexible manufacturing with low minimums to help new brands gain traction, a strategy proven successful with brands like MIA Naturals, which grew volume significantly within 11 months (10:44).
Industry valuations vary widely, with multiples ranging from 2x to 10x revenue depending on infrastructure and growth potential, and some smaller brands achieving extraordinary valuations due to disruptive potential (22:13).
The beverage market’s shift away from traditional liquor sales toward innovative formats like RTDs and plant-based products aligns with their acquisition and growth philosophy (08:07, 21:52).
Operational and Process Improvements
The facility benefits from recent capital investments resulting in new automation and expanded capacity, setting a foundation for scalable growth without legacy inefficiencies common in family-owned operations (19:38).

The approach includes integrating smaller acquisitions under one roof to increase valuation and operational efficiency, as demonstrated by similar consolidations increasing value to $160 million (05:23).
The team emphasized the importance of food safety certifications (GFSI, BRC, SQF) and third-party audits to meet the demands of major retailers and maintain quality standards (06:53).
They plan to update their manufacturing capabilities database with specific line specs, throughput, and hot fill/pasteurization capabilities to better match potential client needs and accelerate business development (26:22).
There is a focus on acquiring an East Coast facility with canning and pasteurization (tunnel pasteurization) capabilities to improve margins and expand geographic reach, with active scouting underway (27:51).
Strategic Partnerships and Future Acquisitions
The team is cultivating strong relationships with venture capital-backed brands and accelerators, handling contract manufacturing needs to allow brands to focus on sales and marketing (11:31).

They maintain a network of over 700 manufacturers and a waiting list of approximately 3,100 companies seeking manufacturing partnerships, indicating significant deal flow and market intelligence (05:23).
The company is preparing to acquire additional beverage and bakery businesses, with bakery identified as a key volume category, recently relocating a 3,600 pallet per month bakery operation from Canada to the U.S. (29:53).
Chris Clifford and Gabriel Borden coordinate closely with Ricardo to share detailed facility specs and acquisition targets, aiming to leverage Ricardo’s expertise and network to identify off-market deals and accelerate growth (29:19).
The plan includes continuing to invest in private label and co-packing, expanding product categories, and geographic presence, with the goal of building a broad, flexible supply chain platform over the next several years (27:55).

Notes
Secondary Share Blocks and Investor Engagement
The team is advancing on two SpaceX secondary share blocks totaling about $37 million with strong investor interest ready to close quickly (06:00).

Primary block of approximately $24.5 million managed by Ali Shekhofti’s entity, Accrete Capital, is structured as an LP interest transfer with a valuation around $1.2 billion for SpaceX shares (06:00).
The seller fee is priced at 7.5% with an additional 1.5% introducer fee split flexibly among parties, allowing negotiation on carry versus fees to maximize returns.
The transaction aims for legal documents within 24 hours and funding by the end of the week, with a hard close deadline on the 13th of January to align with the broader market tender timeline.
Krishnan emphasized the need for company approval for the selling entity and buyer to ensure regulatory compliance and smooth transfer.
Greg confirmed the transfer is approved at the LP interest level, but shares themselves are not being transferred, mitigating company-level hurdles.
Secondary block of $12.5 million sourced by Bert Mole at Prevalent is expected at a much cheaper price with minimal fees, reflecting a high-value proprietary trading relationship (14:07).
Bert has a strong network including close ties to SpaceX’s senior executives, boosting deal sourcing and pricing advantage.
This block is a direct buy rather than an LP interest transfer, adding diversity to acquisition strategy and pricing flexibility.
Greg and Bert are aligning on a partnership model to structure carry and fees efficiently for both blocks.
Matthew highlighted that despite the secondary nature of these deals, the high fees in the tender market (above 10%) make these blocks attractive at 7.5% or below, offering competitive advantage.
The team has $100+ million in ready capital aligned to close alongside the company tender, underscoring strong market demand and urgency for clear, confirmed deal details (13:50).
Due Diligence and Compliance Framework
Clear diligence and compliance steps are established to ensure investor confidence and regulatory adherence for the secondary transactions (15:10).

Due diligence focuses on entity-level and transaction-specific checks, avoiding company-level approvals where possible to speed up closings (15:18).
The SPV operating agreement for Humla Aero vehicle is being prepared for investor review and side letter negotiation.
KYC processes with Accrete Capital are underway to meet investor and regulatory requirements.
Greg will facilitate detailed Q&A with the seller via video calls to address investor concerns, with Gabe and Chris leading diligence interactions.
Krishnan emphasized the critical need to verify that the selling entity has official approval to transfer shares or LP interests, to prevent post-sale issues.
Matthew stressed the importance of providing investors with fully vetted and clear information to avoid ambiguity and build trust when mobilizing sidelined capital.
Timeline Alignment and Market Context
The deal timelines are tightly synced with SpaceX’s employee tender and wider market events to optimize capital deployment and pricing (10:50).

The blocks aim for documentation and funding completion by the third week of January, matching the tender’s closing window.
Greg noted one block was closed and funded at roughly $400 million valuation six weeks ago, predating current tender announcements, highlighting market shifts.
The team is managing the risk of late-stage pricing changes by pushing for early capital commitment and clear deal terms.
Market pricing insights show tenders currently demand at least 10% fees or carry, making the negotiated 7.5% seller fee and below highly attractive.
The partnership approach with sellers and introducers aims to secure favorable fee splits and maintain competitive positioning.
Strategic Partnerships and Growth Potential
Beyond current blocks, the seller relationships and trading partners provide avenues for future deal flow and expanded investment (17:30).

Greg praised the strong alignment with the seller and introducers, noting potential for additional LP interests once the current deals close.
Accrete Capital holds about $1.2 billion in SpaceX valuation across its funds, indicating significant room to scale investments if initial transactions prove successful.
The team’s partnership with Prevalent, a well-regarded prop trading firm, strengthens sourcing capabilities for discounted blocks.
Greg is actively expanding network connections, including meetings with JP Morgan and other investors, to support broader deal origination.
This ecosystem approach supports a multi-block, multi-vendor strategy designed to capture secondary market opportunities efficiently.
Communication and Coordination Protocols
Clear communication channels and defined information needs underpin the current deal execution to avoid delays and confusion (16:00).

Greg outlined a checklist for deal specifics covering entity due diligence, permissions, source fees, and share certificates to standardize investor information.
Matthew advised framing details from an investor perspective, anticipating questions on vehicle structure, share issuance timing, and compliance.
The team commits to transparent, prompt updates to maintain momentum and ensure all parties can confidently commit capital.
Follow-up calls will be scheduled once full deal specifics are confirmed, enabling swift closing on investor commitments.
Greg and Gabe lead coordination between Arrow, Acadian, and Humla Aero teams to align operational efforts and investor outreach.

Notes
Investment Strategy and Deal Flow
The meeting established a clear focus on opportunistic secondary investments and strategic partnerships to expand deal flow and co-investment opportunities.

Gabriel Borden’s firm recently acquired majority control of a company generating $220 million in revenue, highlighting their capability for significant private equity deals and interest in secondary markets (04:38)

The firm is actively involved in early-stage seeds, growth stage secondaries, and has partial exposure to the crypto ecosystem through deals like Poly Market and Fowler Atomics.
Gabriel emphasized their preference for discounted secondary deals, leveraging relationships like the one with Brock Pierce, co-founder of Tether, to access unique opportunities.
The company is exploring a fund buyout involving Tether stock at a 30-40% discount to the primary offering, aiming to involve co-investors in this deal.
This approach positions them to capitalize on illiquid market segments and generate outsized returns by acquiring assets below market value.
Nikhil Punwaney confirmed Moulton’s structure as a £1.5 billion listed fund investing off its balance sheet, allowing patience with capital deployment unlike traditional LP-driven funds (11:34)

Moulton focuses heavily on secondary markets and fund-of-funds strategies, having invested in 84 funds across 51 managers since 2017, including Seedcamp, Speed Invest, and Connect Ventures.
This patient capital model reduces pressure to produce liquidity quickly, supporting longer-term value creation and enabling selective secondary acquisitions.
Moulton’s leadership maintains strong relationships with Ledger and similar platforms but is a buyer-only, not seller, in the Ledger secondary market.
The fund’s extensive LP network and secondary market focus provide a competitive edge in deal sourcing and execution.
Technology and Sector Focus
Both parties aligned on their technology investment priorities, particularly in AI infrastructure and cloud optimization, to leverage sector expertise and identify high-potential opportunities.

Gabriel proposed introducing two AI infrastructure companies, AF Compute and Aspen Labs, as potential investment opportunities aligned with Nikhil’s expertise in AI (18:45)

These companies represent core areas of interest where Gabriel’s team is actively deploying capital and sees strategic value in partnering with specialists.
Gabriel’s approach includes connecting deals to relevant experts on Nikhil’s team, facilitating efficient evaluation and potential co-investment.
The intention is to create a streamlined pipeline for AI-related deals that match Moulton’s investment thesis and speed up decision-making.
Nikhil described his primary focus on cloud infrastructure optimization, including data center energy efficiency and workload rerouting across providers, reflecting a deep understanding of physical layer technology (15:40)

He highlighted the long-term importance of improving cloud performance through renewable energy adoption and better software efficiency.
His second key area is quantum computing, specifically investing in companies bridging current research to practical applications expected around 2035.
Cybersecurity and developer tools remain strategic themes but are currently secondary to infrastructure and quantum investments.
Nikhil emphasized Moulton’s patient capital stance, allowing them to avoid the liquidity-driven pressures common in VC and secondary markets.
Partnership and Communication Workflow
The conversation established clear communication channels and collaboration practices to facilitate deal flow and information sharing.

Gabriel will send AI deal details via email for Nikhil’s prompt evaluation, with a commitment to quick feedback within a week on interest level (19:47)

Nikhil offered to triage deals and route them internally to the most relevant team members based on sector fit, accelerating responses and improving deal quality.
They agreed email is the preferred method to maintain clear context and allow easy introduction of relevant parties, especially for crypto-related opportunities.
Nikhil confirmed the names and roles of key investment team members (Shwetab, Tarun, Luke) to clarify internal points of contact.
Gabriel will reciprocate by connecting Nikhil to his AI investment team, fostering a collaborative co-investment environment.
The teams recognize overlapping investment areas and complementary expertise, setting the foundation for ongoing deal sharing and co-investment discussions (21:55)

Gabriel’s team uses LinkedIn outreach and agent-based sourcing to build a broad network of fund relationships.
Moulton’s established presence and patient capital provide a reliable partnership for secondary market deals.
Both sides expressed intent to deepen relationship with more frequent communications and introductions to maximize deal potential.
This alignment creates a strategic bridge between opportunistic private equity and structured fund-of-funds approaches.
Branding and Market Presence
Insights surfaced regarding digital presence and reputation management as part of broader strategic positioning.

Nikhil flagged a broken LinkedIn link and SEO issues on Gabriel’s Arrow Fund website, noting the presence of a fake LinkedIn profile that could confuse stakeholders (06:29)
Gabriel acknowledged the issues and committed to addressing them to improve discoverability and professional credibility.
The fake profile raises risks around brand misrepresentation and stakeholder trust, which need urgent mitigation.
Improving SEO and correcting online assets will support relationship building and deal sourcing by enhancing Arrow Fund’s market profile.
This feedback underscores the importance of digital hygiene for emerging investment firms competing for mindshare.
Long-Term Vision and Market Position
The meeting revealed shared philosophies around patient capital deployment and selective secondary market engagement, shaping a long-term partnership outlook.

Both leaders emphasized the value of patience in capital deployment to avoid pressure from fund cycles and liquidity demands, enabling more strategic decisions (11:34)
Gabriel’s opportunistic approach to secondaries at discounts complements Moulton’s balance sheet model, creating synergy for joint deals.
This philosophy supports pursuing high-value, discounted secondary stakes without needing quick exits, improving risk-adjusted returns.
Nikhil’s focus on sector-specific deep dives into infrastructure and quantum aligns with Gabriel’s interest in AI and crypto, reinforcing thematic consistency.
The long-term vision includes building a network of co-investors that can flexibly participate across private equity, crypto, and technology growth sectors.
